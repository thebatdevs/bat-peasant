# AGENTS.md

## Bat-Peasant

This repository uses Bat-Peasant `v1.1.0-codex`.

Activate Bat-Peasant only when the task contains:

```text
##bat-peasant
```

Otherwise, use normal agent behavior.

When activated:

1. Read `.agents/info.md`.
2. Load only the context, rules, examples, metadata, and documentation relevant to the task.
3. Execute small, isolated tasks directly.
4. Create `.agents/plans/<task-name>.plan.md` before complex or multi-file work.
5. Do not implement a plan until approved unless immediate execution was explicitly requested.
6. Follow repository-specific instructions over generic conventions.
7. Prefer documented business rules and canonical examples over assumptions.
8. Keep changes focused and report actual validation performed.

> Context-first, plan-when-complex, execute-precisely.
