## Bat-Peasant

This repository uses Bat-Peasant `v1.1.0-codex`.

Activate Bat-Peasant only when the task contains:

```text
##bat-peasant
```

Without this marker, use normal agent behavior.

When activated, begin with:

> **Bat-Peasant activated.** Referencing: `<relevant files>`

List only the `.agents/` files relevant to the task.

## Core Principle

> Context-first, plan-when-complex, execute-precisely.

## `.agents/` Knowledge Base

The `.agents/` directory is the repository-specific source of truth for architecture, business behavior, coding standards, and implementation patterns.

```text
.agents/
├── context/    # Business rules, domain flows, and shared behavior
├── docs/       # Internal libraries, APIs, tools, and technical references
├── examples/   # Canonical implementation examples
├── metadata/   # Architecture, project structure, stack, and version
├── plans/      # Generated implementation plans
├── prompts/    # Task-specific workflows and prompt templates
├── rules/      # Coding, layering, language, framework, and testing rules
└── skills/     # Available agent capabilities and skill metadata
```

Do not load every file automatically. Inspect the directory and read only the files relevant to the current task.

### Directory Usage

- Use `metadata/` to understand the repository before making structural decisions.
- Use `context/` to understand business rules and expected behavior.
- Use `rules/` to determine implementation constraints and coding standards.
- Use `examples/` as the highest-signal reference for code shape and style.
- Use `docs/` when working with internal packages, libraries, APIs, or infrastructure.
- Use `prompts/` to follow the workflow for the current task type.
- Use `plans/` to store approved plans for complex work.
- Use `skills/` to identify available specialized capabilities.

## Instruction Priority

The canonical precedence, applicability test, repository-override rules, and conflict algorithm are defined in [`.agents/info.md`](.agents/info.md#instruction-priority).

In summary, explicit task requirements and an approved plan lead applicable project sources. Source applicability is established before priority is compared, and unresolved material conflicts are reported instead of guessed. Loading order is a discovery optimization and does not change precedence.

## Workflow

### 1. Intake

Identify:

- The requested outcome
- The affected feature or domain
- Relevant `.agents/` files
- Whether direct execution or planning is required

Do not modify files outside the requested scope without a clear reason.

### 2. Context Loading

Use the selective [context-loading sequence](.agents/info.md#2-context-loading) in `.agents/info.md`. Load only enough context to execute the task correctly; discovery order does not alter instruction precedence.

### 3. Task Classification

#### Direct Execution

Execute directly when the task is isolated, clear, and low-risk, such as:

- A single-function change
- A small utility
- A one-file bug fix
- A minor configuration change
- A localized validation or message update

Direct execution still requires reading relevant rules and examples.

#### Planning Required

Planning is mandatory when the task:

- Adds or substantially updates a feature
- Modifies multiple files or layers
- Changes architecture or project structure
- Introduces a new domain flow or integration
- Performs a migration or significant refactor
- Has meaningful dependencies, risks, or trade-offs
- Introduces a pattern not already documented

Use the relevant template under `.agents/prompts/` and write the plan to:

```text
.agents/plans/<task-name>.plan.md
```

The plan must contain:

- Goal
- Scope
- Files to create, modify, or delete
- Relevant context, rules, examples, and documentation
- Key decisions and trade-offs
- Risks and dependencies
- Step-by-step execution order
- Validation and testing considerations

Do not implement until the plan is approved unless the user explicitly requests planning and execution in one task.

### 4. Execution

During implementation:

- Follow the approved plan exactly.
- Preserve existing architecture and layer boundaries.
- Follow repository naming and error-handling conventions.
- Reuse canonical examples before creating new patterns.
- Use existing shared utilities, schemas, and abstractions where appropriate.
- Keep changes focused and minimal.
- Do not silently change business behavior.
- Do not invent missing requirements or conventions.
- Do not perform unrelated cleanup.
- Update the plan or report the issue when execution must deviate from it.

### 5. Validation

Perform validation appropriate to the task, such as:

- Formatting
- Linting
- Type checking
- Compilation or build
- Targeted tests
- Relevant integration checks

Do not claim validation was completed unless it was actually run.

Testing may be handled separately, but every plan must include testing considerations.

### 6. Completion

Report:

- What changed
- Files created, modified, or deleted
- Validation performed
- Any deviations from the approved plan
- Unresolved risks or assumptions
- One relevant follow-up task, when useful

## Decision Boundaries

Ask for clarification before implementation when:

- A requirement materially affects business behavior and cannot be derived from context.
- `.agents/` files contain an unresolved conflict.
- A significant architectural decision has no established precedent.
- A new pattern would replace or bypass an existing documented pattern.

For minor ambiguity, follow the strongest repository precedent and state the assumption.

## Continuous Improvement

After significant tasks, suggest an update to `.agents/` only when the work reveals:

- A missing business rule
- A repeated undocumented pattern
- An outdated example
- A conflicting standard
- Missing technical documentation

Do not modify `.agents/` unless the task explicitly includes documentation maintenance.
